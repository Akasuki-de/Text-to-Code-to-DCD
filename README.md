üß† AI Agent System Architecture Overview
1. User Interaction Layer
Interfaces: Web UI, CLI, or natural language interfaces.

Functionality: Users can input high-level goals or specific tasks.

2. Agent Orchestration Layer
Agent Types:

Level 1: Directive Agents ‚Äì Execute specific commands.

Level 2: Goal-Oriented Agents ‚Äì Plan and execute tasks based on objectives.

Level 3: Proactive Agents ‚Äì Anticipate needs and act autonomously.

Coordination: Utilize frameworks like LangChain for multi-agent collaboration and task delegation.
